# JavaScript Mini Projects Collection

This repository is a curated collection of small yet meaningful JavaScript projects that I built to strengthen my core web development fundamentals. Each project focuses on a specific concept such as DOM manipulation, event handling, logic building, or working with browser APIs.

These are not random tutorials dumped together — every project here was built hands-on with the goal of writing cleaner code, understanding how JavaScript behaves in real scenarios, and improving problem-solving skills.
